# BO1-Full-Solo-Mods
One stop shop for BO1 solo mods. Place the 'Solo Eggs Mod' folder in the 'C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\Plutonium\storage\t5\mods' folder and the 'zombie_moon_patch.ff' file in the '.\pluto_t5_full_game\zone\Common' folder (Click on "Code" --> "Download ZIP" to download). When loaded into the main menu of BO1 click mods -> Solo Eggs Mod to load the mod file. 

Steps modified for solo play:
- Ascension
  * Only one button must be pressed during the monkey round button step
  * LUNA step does not require a player to be on the lander
  * Final step require a gersch device to be thrown at the light sphere and EITHER a pack a punched thundergun or ray-gun to be shot into it
- Call of the Dead
  * Nothing is changed from the original solo easter egg. Solo egg can be completed as normal with this mod active
- Shangri-La
  * Activate all four of the stone switches in spawn in quick succession to activate eclipse mode
  * Stone matching step will auto-complete after a short period of time
  * Waterslide pressure plate step requires only one player to stand on the pressure plate after pulling the switch on the slide
- Moon
  * IMPORTANT: Restart the game until you spawn as Richtofen. He will have the golden rod show up on screen in the bottom right-hand corner
  * The rest of the egg is the same as co-op once you are playing as Richtofen
  * Note: Playing with a mod that alters the '.\pluto_t5_full_game\zone\Common\common_zombie_patch.ff' in combination with this mod may cause the player to be unable to collect the P.E.S. on moon
