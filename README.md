# BO1-Full-Solo-Mods
One stop shop for BO1 solo mods. Place the 'Solo Eggs Mod' folder in the 'C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\Plutonium\storage\t5\mods' folder and the 'zombie_moon_patch.ff' file in the '.\pluto_t5_full_game\zone\Common' folder (Click on "Code" --> "Download ZIP" to download). When loaded into the main menu of BO1 click mods -> Solo Eggs Mod to load the mod file. 

I did not make these mods, but have completed the easter eggs with them multiple times. These are the modified stes as I understand them:
- Ascension
  * All four buttons monkey round buttons must be pressed within a minute and a half of the first button press
  * LUNA step auto completes
  * Final step require a gersch device to be thrown at the light sphere and a pack a punched thundergun to be shot into it (Ray-gun does not work)
- Call of the Dead
  * Nothing is changed from the original solo easter egg. Solo egg can be completed as normal with this mod active
- Shangri-La
  * Activate all four of the stone switches in spawn in quick succession to activate eclipse mode
  * Stone matching step will auto-complete after a short period of time
  * Waterslide pressure plate step requires only one player to stand on the pressure plate after pulling the switch on the slide
- Moon
  * IMPORTANT: Restart the game until you spawn as Richtofen. He will have the golden rod show up on screen in the bottom right-hand corner
  * The rest of the egg is the same as co-op once you are playing as Richtofen
  * Note: Playing with a mod that alters the '.\pluto_t5_full_game\zone\Common\common_zombie_patch.ff' in combination with this mod may cause the player to be unable to collect the P.E.S. on moon

(I am not the creator of any of these mods. However they are becoming increasingly hard to find for new players, so I am reuploading them here as a resource to others)
